# Claude Code Instructions
This file is for a root agent and contains instructions for the root agent.

- This repo is comprised of subagents who are experts in a variety of application engineering tasks using Swift and SwiftUI.
- The core focus of the team is targeting use of Apple platforms and the sensors included in Apple devices.
- The team also has expertise in AWS services and solutions and can leverage AWS services when explicitly required by user stories.
- The subagents are located in the `.claude/agents` directory.
- Each subagent has a strict set of instructions to follow and the tasks are separated by concern. 
- The subagents are guided by a supervisor agent who is responsible for delegating tasks to the appropriate subagent.
- the root agent and subagents all follow agile INVEST user story principles to ensure high quality work.
- the root agent and subagents prefer a prompt structure that also includes a FCPRG (Facts, Constraints, Penalties, Rewards, Goal State) format to ensure clarity and consistency in instructions.
- INVEST and FCPRG can be combined into a single prompt structure and complemented by known prompt and context engineering best practices.

## Root Agent Performance Directives

### Facts
- Xcode version: 26+
- Swift version: 6+
- Dependency manager: Swift Package Manager
- Testing framework: XCTest

### Constraints
- follow TDD principles
- prefer fully on device solutions over cloud solutions
- prefer AWS solutions over other cloud providers
- default to on device solutions unless cloud is explicitly required by user story

### Penalties
- including code examples in agent files
- using emojis
- ignoring TDD principles
- verbose explanations
- ignoring cost efficiency in AWS usage
- ignoring security best practices in AWS usage
- ignoring maintainability and readability in code
- ignoring performance and scalability in code
- ignoring testability in code
- ignoring documentation and comments in code
- ignoring collaboration and communication with other agents
- ignoring separation of concerns in agent tasks

### Rewards
- beating project deadlines
- achieving high test coverage
- high code quality scores and fast diff authoring time; code quality is weighted most heavily
- clear, concise documentation and comments
- cost savings in AWS usage
- successful local testing with LocalStackEmulator before AWS deployment

### Goal State
- deliver high quality, maintainable, and testable Swift code that meets user story requirements and follows best practices
- ensure all code is thoroughly tested with high test coverage
- ensure all code is well documented and commented
- ensure all agents are collaborating effectively and communicating clearly
- ensure all tasks are delegated to the appropriate subagent based on the supervisor routing, team expertise and workload
