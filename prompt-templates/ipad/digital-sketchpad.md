# Digital Sketchpad - iPad User Story

## User Story (INVEST)

**As a** digital artist
**I want** a drawing app optimized for Apple Pencil with ML-powered shape recognition
**So that** I can create artwork with professional tools without cloud dependencies

### INVEST Checklist
- **Independent**: Self-contained digital art creation app
- **Negotiable**: Brush types, layers, export formats
- **Valuable**: Professional drawing with on-device ML features
- **Estimable**: PencilKit and Vision frameworks well-defined
- **Small**: Core features in 3-4 week sprint
- **Testable**: Clear drawing and export criteria

## Facts

- **Platform**: iPad (iPadOS 17+)
- **Swift Version**: 6+
- **Primary Frameworks**: PencilKit, Vision, Core ML, SwiftUI
- **Hardware**: Apple Pencil (pressure, tilt, double-tap)
- **ML Features**: Shape recognition, handwriting-to-text
- **Storage**: Local file system, Files app integration
- **No Cloud Services**: All artwork stored locally

## Constraints

- Follow TDD principles
- Optimize for Apple Pencil latency (<9ms)
- Support pressure and tilt
- Implement layers with blend modes
- Use Vision for shape recognition
- Export to PNG, PDF, PSD formats
- Integrate with Files app
- Support undo/redo extensively
- Handle large canvases efficiently

## Penalties

- Cloud storage requirements
- Pencil latency >20ms
- Missing pressure sensitivity
- No layer support
- Poor export quality
- Memory leaks with large canvases
- Missing undo/redo

## Rewards

- Ultra-low latency drawing
- Professional brush engine
- ML-powered shape perfection
- Unlimited layers
- High-resolution export
- Files app integration
- Intuitive interface
- High test coverage (>80%)

## Goal State

Deliver a professional drawing app that:
- Provides sub-20ms Apple Pencil latency
- Supports unlimited layers with blend modes
- Recognizes and perfects shapes using Vision
- Converts handwriting to text on-device
- Exports to PNG, PDF, PSD formats
- Integrates with Files app for storage
- Offers brush customization
- Maintains >80% test coverage

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **GIVEN** Apple Pencil drawing **WHEN** user draws **THEN** latency <15ms with pressure sensitivity
2. **GIVEN** shape recognition enabled **WHEN** circle drawn **THEN** Vision perfects to geometric circle
3. **GIVEN** multiple layers **WHEN** changing order **THEN** rendering updates correctly
4. **GIVEN** exporting **WHEN** selecting format **THEN** high-res file saves to Files app
5. **GIVEN** handwriting **WHEN** selecting text mode **THEN** Natural Language converts to typed text

## Technical Notes

### Frameworks
- **PencilKit**: PKCanvasView, PKDrawing, PKTool
- **Vision**: VNDetectContoursRequest for shape recognition
- **Natural Language**: Handwriting recognition
- **Files**: UIDocumentPickerViewController
- **QuickLook**: Document preview

### Data Model
```
Artwork: id, name, canvasSize, layers, createdDate, modifiedDate
Layer: id, drawing (PKDrawing), opacity, blendMode, visible
```

### Testing
- Latency performance tests
- Shape recognition accuracy
- Export format validation
- Large canvas memory tests
