# Virtual Workspace Organizer - Vision Pro User Story

## User Story (INVEST)

**As a** knowledge worker
**I want** to organize virtual windows in 3D space
**So that** I can create custom spatial workflows

## Facts
- Platform: visionOS 1.0+, Frameworks: SwiftUI, RealityKit, ARKit
- Windows: Multiple SwiftUI windows in 3D space, No cloud sync

## Constraints
- TDD, spatial window management, hand tracking, persistence, accessibility, eye tracking for selection

## Goal State
Workspace manager with saved window layouts, spatial anchors, gesture-based arrangement, workspace presets

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create multiple floating windows
2. Arrange in 3D space with hand gestures
3. Save workspace layouts locally
4. Switch between workspace presets
5. Window follows eye gaze for repositioning

## Technical Notes
- WindowGroup for multiple windows
- Spatial anchors for persistence
- Hand tracking for manipulation
- SwiftData for layout storage
